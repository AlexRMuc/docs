### Using one click deploy - ‚úÖ Recommended

You can easily setup Rowy on your Google Cloud/Firebase project using the

instance and guide you with a step by step process.

Before starting make sure you have a firebase project setup with **Firestore** and **Firebase Auth** enabled.

#### Deploy!

Click the buttonüëá

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run/?git_repo=https://github.com/rowyio/rowyRun.git)

Note this runs Rowy Run (an open source, cloud run instance) that operates
exclusively on your GCP project and we will never have access to your service
account or any of your data.

Once installed, you will be given an URL to the Rowy App and follow it to get
started as highlighted below.
