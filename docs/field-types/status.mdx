The **Status field** allows users to set the **state** of a record, which sets the data based on the value
selected in the Status field.

For example, if the user needs a field to **hold the status** of candidate applications for a job opening, the 
Status field can come in handy. 

The user can create a Status field with values `'0' (Applied)`, `'1' (Shortlisted)`,
`'2' (Rejected)`, `'3' (Hired)` and `'4' (On Hold)`. The user can then use the Status field to set the state of the
candidate's application.


## Steps

1. After creating a table and the required columns, click on the **Add Column** button to add a new column.
2. Add the **Column Name** and set the field type to **Status**.
3. Set the **Default value type** according to the requirement. It is the default value that the cell would 
    hold when the user creates a new row. 
4. Now, the user can add **Conditions**. Conditions can be easily configured according to the user needs.
5. Click on the **Update button**.
