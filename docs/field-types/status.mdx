The **Status field** allows users to set the **state** of a record, which sets the data based on the value
selected in the Status field.

For example, if the user needs a field to **hold the status** of candidate applications for a job opening, the 
Status field can come in handy. 

The user can create a Status field with values `'0' (Applied)`, `'1' (Shortlisted)`,
`'2' (Rejected)`, `'3' (Hired)` and `'4' (On Hold)`. The user can then use the Status field to set the state of the
candidate application.
