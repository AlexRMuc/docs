The **Status field** allows users to set the **state** of a record, which sets the data based on the value
selected in the Status field.

For example, if the user needs a field to **hold the status** of candidate applications for a job opening, the 
Status field can come in handy. 

The user can create a Status field with values `'0' (Applied)`, `'1' (Shortlisted)`,
`'2' (Rejected)`, `'3' (Hired)` and `'4' (On Hold)`. The user can then use the Status field to set the state of the
candidate's application.


## Steps

1. After creating a table and the required columns, click on the **Add Column** button to add a new column.
2. Add the **Column Name** and set the field type to **Status**.
3. Set the **Default value type** according to the requirement. It is the default value that the cell would 
    hold when the user creates a new row. 

    The **default value type** can be set to:

    ### Undefined
    The **default value is not set**. The undefined values **do not appear if the list is sorted** in 
    ascending / descending order. This makes the column field unsortable if left blank.

    ### Null
    The default value is set to `Null`. The **Null type** allows the column to be sortable without setting
    an actual value.

    ### Static
    The **Static type** enables the user to customize the initial value of the column. The user can set
    the value to any of the values in the **Status field**.
    
    ### Dynamic
    The default value also supports a **Dynamic type**. The user can **set the default value automatically**,
    making it adhere to specific conditions once a new row is created.

4. Now, the user can add **Conditions**. Conditions can be easily configured according to the user needs. The
 user will be able to select the **cell label** from the dropdown (existing conditions) and the **corresponding
 value will be set in the Firebase Collection**.
 
5. Click on the **Update button**.
