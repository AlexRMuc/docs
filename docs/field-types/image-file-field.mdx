The Image or File fields enable users to upload images or files. These photos or documents are subsequently 
uploaded to the Firestore, and the returned URL populates the table's columns.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add column** button on the right edge of the table header.
2. Set the user-facing **Column name**.
3. Set the **Field key**, which is the name of the field in your Firestore
   document.
4. Set the **Field type** to either **Image** or **File** depending upon the requirement.
5. Upload the image or text using the **Upload Icon** or simply drag and drop it into the desired cell.
