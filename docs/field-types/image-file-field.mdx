The Image or File fields enable users to upload images or files. These photos or documents are subsequently 
uploaded to the Firestore, and the returned URL populates the table's columns.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add column** button on the right edge of the table header.

<img 
   src = {imageField}
   alt = "Adding an image column"
/>

2. Set the user-facing **Column name**.
3. Set the **Field key**, which is the name of the field in your Firestore
   document.
4. Set the **Field type** to either **Image** or **File** depending upon the requirement.
5. Upload the image or text using the **Upload Icon** or simply drag and drop it into the desired cell.

<img 
   src = {populatedField}
   alt = "Adding an image column"
/>

## Working

Once the image or file is uploaded, it is synced to the connected Firestore database.
A URL is then generated which gets returned to the user, and gets populated in the Rowy table.

By navigating to the side menu, the user can check out all the details of the current row, including
the **Reference Path**, which is the Firestore path where the upload is stored.

<img 
   src = {firestorePath}
   alt = "Firestore path"
/>

Using this link, the user can access the **Firebase Firestore datapoint** for a specific file. 
This is useful for utilizing the **Firebase Storage API**.

<img 
   src = {firestoreJSON}
   alt = "Firestore JSON"
/>
