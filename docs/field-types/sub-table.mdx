# Sub-Tables

Sub-Tables or Sub-Collections are a way to create a table within a table. This is useful for creating a table of related data, such as a list of products within an order. Adding sub-tables would connect to a sub-table in every row. 

The user can also create **nested sub-tables** fitting their usecase by adding a sub-table to a sub-table. However, **Firebase limits the maximum depth of a sub-collection to 100 levels.**
