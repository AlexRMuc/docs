Sub-Tables or Sub-Collections are a way to create a table within a table. This is useful for creating a table of related data, such as a list of products within an order.

The user can also create **nested sub-tables**, fitting their usecase, by adding a sub-table to a sub-table. However, **Firebase limits the maximum depth of nested sub-collections to 100 levels.**
