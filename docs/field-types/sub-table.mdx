Sub-Tables or Sub-Collections are a way to create a table within a table. This is useful for creating a table of related data, such as a list of products within an order.

Users can also create **nested sub-tables**, fitting their usecase, by adding a sub-table to a sub-table. However, **Firebase limits the maximum depth of nested sub-collections to 100 levels.**


## Creating a Sub-Table

1. To create a sub-table, add a new column to your table and select the **Sub-Table** field type. 

    <img src={subTable1} alt="Sub-Table" />

2. Thereafter, you can select the **Parent Label** for the sub-table from any of the given columns in the table. Note that the **Parent Label** can only be a column with a **Text** field type. Click on **Update**.

    <img src={subTable2} alt="Sub-Table" />

3. You can then add fields to the sub-table as you would in any other table. You can also create a sub-table within a sub-table, creating a **nested structure**.


As with any other Rowy table, you can include **Extensions**, **Derivatives**, **Connectors**, etc. in your sub-tables.


## Accessing the Parent Doc from a Sub-Table

A sub-table can access the fields of the parent table by using the **Parent Doc** object as reference. The following piece of code can be used to access the **Parent Doc** object:

```js
 const parentDoc: any = await ref.parent.parent.get().then(snap => snap.data());
```

Henceforth, we can access the fields of the parent table by using the **Parent Doc** object. For example, if we have a **Parent Label** of **Order ID** in our sub-table, we can access the **Order ID** field of the parent table by using the following code:

```js
const orderID = parentDoc.orderID;
```
