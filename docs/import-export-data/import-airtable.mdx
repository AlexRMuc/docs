Rowy allows users to create a new table from an existing Airtable collection. This is useful if you have a pre-existing data on Airtable and want to import it to Rowy.

Rowy allows a lot of new functionalities that gives you more control over your data. Users can not just view their Firestore data in an Airtable-like UI, but also **build cloud functions**, **automations and workflows** based on their data. **Connect to any third-party tool**, use NPM and APIs right in the browser without the hassle of CLIs, terminals or native consoles.
