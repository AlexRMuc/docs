Rowy allows users to create a new table from an existing Airtable collection. This is useful if you have a pre-existing data on Airtable and want to import it to Rowy.

Rowy allows a lot of new functionalities that gives you more control over your data. Users can not just view their Firestore data in an Airtable-like UI, but also **build cloud functions**, **automations and workflows** based on their data. **Connect to any third-party tool**, use NPM and APIs right in the browser without the hassle of CLIs, terminals or native consoles.

## Steps

1. After creating a new table, click on the **Import Data** button.

2. Select **Airtable** as the data source.
    <img 
        src={importData} 
        alt="Importing data from an airtable collection" 
    />

3. Add the **Airtable API key** and the **Table URL**. You can find how to generate the API key and the Table URL in the sections below.


## API Key

1. Go to your [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/account) and click on **Generate API key**.

2. Copy the API key and paste it in the **API Key** field in Rowy.
