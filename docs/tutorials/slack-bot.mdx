Using Rowy's low-code UI for Firebase, you can simply develop a cloud function that sends Slack messages whenever data in the Firestore collection updates.

Rowy provides ready-to-use code blocks, known as **Extensions**, for cloud functions. Extensions can be customized easily using JavaScript or TypeScript, in a built-in code editor.

## What are Slack bots?

Slack is a business chat platform that links people to the information they require. Slack changes how businesses communicate by uniting employees to work as a single cohesive team.

A **bot** is a specific kind of Slack app made to converse with users. A bot can access the same set of APIs as a regular app and perform all the same tasks as a Slack app, just like a regular app.

## Creating a Slack Bot from scratch

It is super simple to create a Slack Bot **using Rowy's Slack extension**, which provides a ready-to-use code block. It offers users the flexibility to either use the Extensions as it is or go down to the code level and implement their logic.

In this tutorial blog, we’ll **create a Slack Bot that sends a message in a Slack Text Channel whenever a new row is added** to your Rowy Project.

### Prerequisites

- A Rowy account with Rowy-Run set up (If not, you can quickly create one by following the instructions on https://rowy.app.)

- A Slack Account (Create one on https://app.slack.com)

## Steps

### Slack App Integration

1. To begin creating a Slack Bot, we need to **create or join a Workspace**.

2. Now, we can head over to the [Slack API website](https://api.slack.com/) to configure the new app for our Bot. Click on the **Your Apps** button in the top right corner. This page will display all the existing apps you have created.

3. Click on **Create a New App**. A modal appears with options to select the configuration for the App scopes, settings, and features. We’ll be creating an app **From Scratch**. 

    If you have an existing manifest file, feel free to use the **From an app manifest** option.

4. Set an App Name and pick a Workspace to develop your app in. Click on **Create App**.

5. After creating the app, we will land on the **Slack App Dashboard**. Now, we’ll have to configure the features and functionalities our Bot will possess. Under the **Add features and functionality** section, click on **Bots**.

6. Further, we’ll be assigning scopes. In layman's terms, we’ll be giving our Bot permissions to perform activities in the channels, by going to the **Review Scopes to Add** section.

7. This will redirect us to the **OAuth & Permissions** page on the Slack App Dashboard. We’ll go down to the **Bot Token Scopes** section and **Add permission by Scope or API method**. We can now see that we have a list of different scopes and permissions for the Bot.

    For now, we’ll only be needing the `chat:write` permission, which would allow our Bot to send messages to a channel. Users can add all the permissions if they wish to.
