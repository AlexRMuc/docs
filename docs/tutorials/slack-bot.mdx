Using Rowy's low-code UI for Firebase, you can simply develop a cloud function that sends Slack messages whenever data in the Firestore collection updates.

Rowy provides ready-to-use code blocks, known as **Extensions**, for cloud functions. Extensions can be customized easily using JavaScript or TypeScript, in a built-in code editor.

## What are Slack bots?

Slack is a business chat platform that links people to the information they require. Slack changes how businesses communicate by uniting employees to work as a single cohesive team.

A **bot** is a specific kind of Slack app made to converse with users. A bot can access the same set of APIs as a regular app and perform all the same tasks as a Slack app, just like a regular app.
