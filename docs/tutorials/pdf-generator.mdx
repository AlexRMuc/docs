Build your App's back-end instantaneously with Rowy extensions on top of your data. 

In this tutorial, we're going to explore how to build a simple PDF generator by using a Figma design as a
template for dynamically creating fancy certificates and tickets.

Note: This tutorial is an advanced usage.  

## Step 1: Create a design template

We will use the Figma design by exporting it as SVG, making it easier to find and manipulate the corresponding fields programmatically. 

To make things easier, there are a couple of design preferences that you may follow:
- Use the universal A4 paper format (595x842) in the landscape form (842x595) for the main frame, to avoid any issues regarding the PDF page size.
- Use a rectangle block to specify a fillable field in the template. This will come in handy while making fields responsive.
- Use the `id` attribute's export option which will be helpful to find the proper field in the program logic.

Below is a simple Certificate Template that can be used:

Figma uses the exact name at the sidebar while exporting the SVG. So, be sure that there isn't any conflict. We're going to select the recipient field by the id of "recipient" in the extension logic.

Lastly, don't forget to mark `Include "id" attribute` in the export options.

You can preview your SVG template by opening it on your favorite browser, and the design step is done. The text fonts do not look as expected right now, but we'll take care of it later!

## Step 2: Initialize Rowy table structure

The table scheme has 4 columns for the inputs of template, and the output column for the generated PDF file:
- `Template` column as `File` type
- `Description Text` column as `Long Text` type
- `Issue Date` column as `Date` type
- `Recipient Name` column as `Short Text` type
- `Certificate` column as `File` type

## Step 3: Create a Rowy extension

We'll be using a single [Rowy Extension](https://docs.rowy.io/extensions) which is simply a cloud function that runs after row-level CRUD operations. The program flow is as simple as when the input fields are created or updated, we'll run a cloud function to generate a PDF file by using the recently created/updated row data.

Create a new extension and set the `Tracked Fields` to all 4 input columns so the extension will get triggered by any changes.

![Extension configuration](./assets/pdf-generator-6.png)

In the `Extension Body`, weâ€™ll write Javascript code. This will be magically deployed by Rowy as a cloud function.

This function will run using Node.js. So, we can use any NPM packages we'd need to fasten our development.

We'll get benefit of 3 NPM packages:

- `puppeteer`, a headless Chrome launcher
- `jsdom`, DOM manipulation in Node.js
- `dayjs`, localize Date objects in Node.js


You can use CommonJS modules here to load NPM packages. Rowy detects and installs external libraries while deploying functions.
```tsx
const extensionBody: TaskBody = async ({ row, db, change, ref }) => {
  // Rowy detects and installs external libraries defined as below
  const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");
  const { JSDOM } = require("jsdom");
  const dayjs = require('dayjs');
  const localizedFormat = require('dayjs/plugin/localizedFormat');
  dayjs.extend(localizedFormat);
}
```

The program logic consists of 4 simple consequent steps:
- Retrieve the template from storage
- Parse the template with `jsdom` and manipulate the fields by inputs
- Open the manipulated SVG with `puppeteer` and generate PDF from it
- Upload the PDF to storage, and update the output column


### Retrieve the design template

As we used `File` column type to store template into storage, Rowy structured our storage file as a Firestore document which helps us to retrieve a file declaratively. `File` consists an array of files that stored in our Firebase Storage. In this tutorial, we'll only use a single template file, it sits there in the zero index of column `template`.

```tsx
const template = await fetch(row.template[0].downloadURL)
  .then(resp => resp.blob())
  .then(data => data.text())
```

### Manipulate the SVG template

By using `jsdom` library, it parses that template from raw text and creates an emulator we can use standard DOM facilities to manipulate our template.

```tsx
const dom = new JSDOM(template);
const { document } = dom.window;
```

Now, we can use DOM selectors to access elements. We'll first create a bunch of auxilary functions to make things more organized such as `createTextElement`, `createStylesElement`, `createForeignObject`, and `getAttributes`.
```tsx
const svg = document.querySelector("svg");
svg.appendChild(createTextElement("description", row.descriptionText));
svg.appendChild(createTextElement("recipient", row.recipientName));
const dateText = dayjs(row.issueDate.toDate()).format("LL");
svg.appendChild(createTextElement("date", dateText));
document.head.appendChild(createStylesElement());
```

The entire DOM manipulation logic goes over there but the implementation is a bit nasty as DOM manipulation itself is quite an iterative process. 

First, we'll inject a `foreignObject` for every fillable fields into SVG which has the same exact position as the corresponding rectangle block in our design template. This way, you'll have a `div` element you can use CSS for styling it.

```tsx
// Creates a foreignObject element with given attributes
const createForeignObject = (attrs) => {
  const el = document.createElementNS(
    "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml",
    "foreignObject"
  );
  Object.keys(attrs).forEach((key) => el.setAttribute(key, attrs[key]));
  return el;
};

// Returns attributes of an element 
// i.e { id: "recipient", x: "50", y: "100", width: "300", height: "175" }
const getAttributes = (el) =>
  el.getAttributeNames().reduce((hash, key) => {
    hash[key] = el.getAttribute(key);
    return hash;
  }, {});

// Creates `div` element with given text
const createTextElement = (targetId, text) => {
  const targetEl = document.getElementById(targetId);
  const attrs = getAttributes(targetEl);
  const foreignObjectEl = createForeignObject(attrs);
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  div.setAttribute("xmlns", "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml");
  div.className = targetId;
  div.innerHTML = text;
  foreignObjectEl.appendChild(div);
  return foreignObjectEl;
};
```

Lastly, we'll append CSS styles into document `head` to style our injected elements.

```tsx
// creates a `style` element
const createStylesElement = () => {
  const styleEl = document.createElement("style");
  styleEl.appendChild(
    document.createTextNode(`
    @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;500;600;700");
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Qwitcher+Grypen:wght@400;700&display=swap');
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Rakkas&display=swap');
    body {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      font-family: "Inter", sans-serif;
    }
    .description, .recipient, .date {
      position: relative;
      top: 50%;
      transform: translateY(-50%);
    }
    .description, .recipient, .date {
        text-align: center;
    }
    .description {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
    .recipient {
      color: #314E85;
      font-size: 40px;
      font-weight: 600;
    }
    .date {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
  `)
  );
  return styleEl;
};
```

### Generate a PDF

`puppeteer` will generate the PDF from manipulated `dom` as shown below.
```tsx
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.setContent(dom.serialize(), { waitUntil: "networkidle0" });
const pdf = await page.pdf({ printBackground: true });
await browser.close();
```

### Upload file into storage, and update the output column

```tsx
const pdfFile = await rowy.storage.upload.data(pdf, { 
  fileName: "certificate.pdf",
  folderPath: `certificateGenerator/${ref.id}`
});
await ref.update({ certificate: [pdfFile] });
```

## Step 4: Increase RAM allocation

Finally, Rowy deploys the cloud functions with a minimal setup by default which has only 256MB of RAM. `puppeteer` cannot operate with this amount of memory. So, as a last step you have to increase the memory of your recenlty deployed cloud function. You can follow the instructions [here](/tutorials/spotify-wrapped#step-5-increase-ram-allocation).

### Create template for Tickets

This time, we'll use a template with portrait page format(595x842). The fields are the same as minimal `Certificate` example except we're going to include a dynamically generated QR code, and Google Maps.

### Initialize Rowy table and subtable structure

We're going to have a little more relational data structure now. The main table will store event specific information such as `eventDate`, `eventAddress`, `ticketTemplate`, and the subtable will store consumer specific information like `purchaserName`, and `ticketType`. 

By this design, we'll be able to generate event specific tickets by using the same template for many tickets with assistance of the relational data structure.

![Subtable schema](./assets/pdf-generator-9.png)

### Creating a Rowy extension for subcollection

Except QR Code and Maps generation, every step is identical with the previous `Certiciate` example. For this example, we'll going to trigger the extension only after `tickets` subtable got updated. You can define extensions for your subcollections the same way we did for `Certificate` generator.
