Build your own Twitter Bot using Rowy and Twitter API. This tutorial will show you how to create a Twitter Bot that will automatically reply with a screenshots to tweets that contain a specific keyword.

## Setting up the Twitter API

### Step 1: Register on the Twitter Developer Portal

First, you need to register on the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). You will need to create a Twitter account if you don't have one already.

**NOTE:** You will need to verify your account by adding your phone number. To do this, go to your [Twitter Account Settings](https://twitter.com/settings/account). Click on the Account Information section and update your phone number.

### Step 2: Applying for Elevated Access

This project will require an Elevated Access, since we'll be using the Twitter API to get the tweets posted by an account. 

For that, let us first create a new app. The name of the app requires its name to be unique. Click on the **Get Keys** button.
