Build your own Twitter Bot using Rowy and Twitter API. This tutorial will show you how to create a Twitter Bot that will automatically reply with a screenshots to tweets that contain a specific keyword.

## Setting up the Twitter API

### Step 1: Register on the Twitter Developer Portal

First, you need to register on the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). You will need to create a Twitter account if you don't have one already.

**NOTE:** You will need to verify your account by adding your phone number. To do this, go to your [Twitter Account Settings](https://twitter.com/settings/account). Click on the Account Information section and update your phone number.

### Step 2: Creating a Twitter App

This project will require an Elevated Access, since we'll be using the Twitter API to get the tweets posted by an account. 

For that, let us first create a new app. The name of the app requires its name to be unique. Click on the **Get Keys** button.

Now, this will generate the API keys and tokens that we'll need to use the Twitter API. Copy the **API Key**, **API Key Secret**, and the **Bearer Token**.


### Step 3: Applying for Elevated Access

On the **Project Dashboard Overview** section, we get a pop-up that asks us if we wish to apply for Elevated Access. Click on the **Apply** button.

This will take you to a form which will ask you to provide the purpose of requirement of an elevated access. Fill in the form and submit.
