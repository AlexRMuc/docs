Rows display individual documents in your Firestore collection.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add row** button above the table.
2. You can edit fields directly in the row or the Side Drawer.

## Modes for ID generation while adding a row

Every row has a **distinct Row ID** which helps to differentiate it from the other rows. Data stored in the
Firebase Firestore is **sorted in ascending order** in the Rowy Table, according to the Row ID.

Rowy gives you option to choose how row's ID value is generated. Click the small inverted triange next to the "Add Row" button to see the list of options.

### Rowy supports three modes for adding a row:

### To top

This is the default option. Generates a ** Row ID that is smaller** than the Row ID of the row at the top of the table, so that the 
newly added row is displayed at the top of your screen.

### With random ID
This mode assigns a **random Row ID** to the new row. By default, the row will be displayed on the top 
while it is being edited. Later, it **will appear at a different position** in the table, according to the 
generated Row ID.

### With custom ID
Generating a row with a **custom Row ID** is **very similar to generating a row With random ID**. Just 
like the random ID mode, the row will be displayed on the top while it is being edited. Later, it **will 
appear at a different position** in the table.

The difference is that the **user is given the liberty to choose the Row ID** and the position of that row 
is set accordingly.

## Notes

- If a column is set to **required**, the row will not be written to Firestore
  until the fieldâ€™s value is set.
- If a column has a [default value](./default-values.mdx) set, it will
  automatically set values after you add the row.
