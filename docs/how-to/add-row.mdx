Rows display individual documents in your Firestore collection.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add row** button above the table.
2. Choose from any of the three modes for adding a new row, i.e. **To top**, **With random ID**, and 
**With custom ID**.
3. You can edit fields directly in the row or the Side Drawer.

## Modes for adding a row

Every row has a **distinct Row ID** which helps to differentiate it from the other rows. Data stored in the
Firebase Firestore is **sorted in ascending order** in the Rowy Table, according to the Row ID.

Rowy supports three modes for adding a row:

### To top
Generates a **Row ID that is smaller** than the Row ID of the row at the top of the table, so that the 
newly added row is added to the top.

### With random ID
This mode assigns a **random Row ID** to the new row. By default, the row will be displayed on the top 
while it is being edited. Later, it **will appear at a different position** in the table, according to the 
generated Row ID.

### With custom ID
Generating a row with a **custom Row ID** is **very similar to generating a row With random ID**. Just 
like the random ID mode, the row will be displayed on the top while it is being edited. Later, it **will 
appear at a different position** in the table.

The difference is that the **user is given the liberty to choose the Row ID** and the position of that row 
is set accordingly.


## Notes

- If a column is set to **required**, the row will not be written to Firestore
  until the fieldâ€™s value is set.
- If a column has a [default value](./default-values.mdx) set, it will
  automatically set values after you add the row.
