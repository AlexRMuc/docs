Rows display individual documents in your Firestore collection.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add row** button above the table.
2. Choose from any of the three modes for adding a new row, i.e. **To top**, **With random ID**, and 
**With custom ID**.
3. You can edit fields directly in the row or the Side Drawer.

## Notes

- If a column is set to **required**, the row will not be written to Firestore
  until the fieldâ€™s value is set.
- If a column has a [default value](./default-values.mdx) set, it will
  automatically set values after you add the row.
