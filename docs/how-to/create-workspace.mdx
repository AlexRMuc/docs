Workspace displays a collection of the Rowy projects. You can easily add your team members to the 
workspace and manage their access to the projects.

## Steps

1. After creating an account, the user will be redirected to the **Create Workspace page**.
2. Click on the **Create Workspace Button**.
3. Set the name of the workspace and the user role on the pop-up modal.
4. Click on the **Next button**.
5. Enter any prompted information and click **Next**.

## Notes

- Currently, Rowy supports only one workspace, with multiple projects, per account.
- Features to customize the workspace and add multiple workspaces will be added in the future versions.
