- Filter and sort data columns
- Freeze columns to dock on the left for better navigation
- Lock columns to make them only viewable and not editable
- Create multiple table views for the same collection using different Table IDs
  and assign specific user roles perms for them. This allows granulate access
  and permission control at table and field level
