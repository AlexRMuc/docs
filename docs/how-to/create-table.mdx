2. Choose which **Collection** to display.
3. Set the **Table name** and other display options.

6. Optionally, initialize your table with columns.

## Notes

- You can
  [create multiple tables pointing to the same collection](./multiple-tables.mdx)
  to show different views for different users.
- If you delete a table, only the Rowy table config will be removed. No
  collection data will not be deleted.
