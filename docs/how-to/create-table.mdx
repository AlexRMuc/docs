Tables display your Firestore collections in a spreadsheet UI.

## Steps

1. Click the **+** button in the **Create Table Section** on the Home page.
2. Choose which **Collection** the new table will be connected to, using the **Table Type** and 
**Collection** fields.
3. Set the **Table name** and other display options including the **Description** and **Sections**.
4. Set who can view and edit the table using the **Access Control** tab. By default, only users with the 
`ADMIN` role can read, write, and modify the table content.
5. Users can **optionally** opt to enable **Auditing** for the table. Auditing will record all changes 
to the table.
6. Users can also **choose to initialize their table** with columns from an already existing table.

## Auditing Fields

The optional **Auditing options** for a table can be enabled while creating the table. The **Auditing** 
tab allows you to set which fields will be audited when a user updates a table.
Rowy provides an audit trail for each table. The audit trail is a log of all changes to the table.

This can be useful when the **ADMIN** wishes to keep a track whenever a user creates or updates a row.

If enabled in the beginning, the **Audit Options** can also be disabled, by accessing the 
**Table Settings** on the top right corner of the table.

Otherwise, if unabled while creating the table, the **Auditing Options** can also be enabled later, the
same way as above.


## Notes

- You can
  [create multiple tables pointing to the same collection](./multiple-tables.mdx)
  to show different views for different users.
- If you delete a table, only the Rowy table config will be removed. No
  collection data will not be deleted.
