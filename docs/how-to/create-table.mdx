import Video from "../../src/components/Video.js";
import videoUrl from "./assets/create-table.mp4";

Click the plus icon on the bottom-right corner of the Rowy app home page and
follow the instructions to add your table details.

<Video url={videoUrl} playing loop muted playsinline controls />

### Note

- You can create multiple views of the same collection using different TableIDs
- The first time you create a table, you need to add a section (suggested:
  "DEFAULT") and permission role of who can see it (as "ADMIN")
- If you delete a table, only the config of the table on Rowy will be removed
  and the actual contents of the collection on your Firestore will not be
  deleted
