Columns display individual fields in your Firestore documents.

## Steps

1. Click the **Add column** button on the right edge of the table header.
2. Set the user-facing **Column name**.
3. Set the **Field key**, which is the name of the field in your Firestore
   document.
4. Set the **Field type**. See the
   [list of supported field types](../field-types/supported-fields.mdx).
5. If additional configuration is required for the field type, the Column
   settings modal will appear when you click **Continue**.

## Notes

- You can set [default values](./default-values.mdx) for fields.
- You can set fields to be **required**, which will prevent the row from being
  written to Firestore if the value is not set.
- You can validate the userâ€™s input with a character limit and regex on Short
  Text fields.
