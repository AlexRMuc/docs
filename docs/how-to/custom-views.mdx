You can customize your table view to see exactly the data you want.

- Filter and sort columns for yourself or all users.
- Freeze columns to the left.
- Lock columns to disable edits.

You can also
[create multiple tables pointing to the same collection](./multiple-tables.mdx)
to show different views for different users.
