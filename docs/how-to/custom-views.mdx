## Customizing Table View Options

### Freeze Columns
The **Freeze Column** option of the table view enables the user to fix a specific column on the screen. 
This feature is useful while accessing the other columns with the frozen column locked in place and 
unaffected by the scroll.

The user can **unfreeze** the columns by simply toggling the freeze button.

by means of simple dragging.
