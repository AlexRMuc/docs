You can customize your table view to see exactly the data you want.

- Filter and sort columns for yourself or all users.
- Freeze columns to the left.
- Lock columns to disable edits.

You can also
[create multiple tables pointing to the same collection](./multiple-tables.mdx)
to show different views for different users.

## Customizing Table View Options

### Freeze Columns
The **Freeze Column** option of the table view enables the user to fix a specific column on the screen. 
This feature is useful while accessing the other columns with the frozen column locked in place and 
unaffected by the scroll.

The user can **unfreeze** the columns by simply toggling the freeze button.
