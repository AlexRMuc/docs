## Option 1: Quick deploy â€“ âœ… Recommended

You can easily set up Rowy on your Google Cloud or Firebase project using the
following one-click deploy button, which will guide you with a step-by-step
process.

:::warning Required

Before starting, make sure you have a Google Cloud or Firebase project with
**Firestore** and **Firebase Authentication** enabled.

Click the button ðŸ‘‡

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run/?git_repo=https://github.com/rowyio/rowyRun.git)

This runs Rowy Run, an open source Cloud Run instance that operates exclusively
on your GCP project, so we never have access to any of your data. Like Rowy,
itâ€™s completely open source and free to use.

Once installed, youâ€™ll be given an URL to the Rowy app to continue installation:

to install it manually for development. You should be familiar with
