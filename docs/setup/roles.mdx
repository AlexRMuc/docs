Rowy uses role-based access controls through Firestore Security Rules and custom
claims in Firebase Authentication.

## Set user roles

To allow users to access any of your data in Rowy, they must have user roles
set. If you are an `ADMIN`, you can set them in User Management or using the
Firebase Admin SDK.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="user-management" label="User Management" default>

### Set user roles in User Management

In User Management, you can set the roles of users who have already signed in to
your Rowy project. You can write any custom role and set your table roles
accordingly.

/>
<br />
<br />

### Invite users in User Management

You can also invite a user who hasnâ€™t signed in to your Rowy project in User
Management.

Click Invite User and enter the userâ€™s email address and set their roles. Rowy
Run will create a new Firebase Authentication user with those details. Weâ€™ll
send them an email inviting them to sign up to your Rowy project.

:::info Invite URL

By default, the invite URL sent in the email assumes youâ€™ve deployed Rowy on
[rowy.app](https://rowy.app/deploy). If youâ€™re self-hosting Rowy, this link will
not work for your users.

### Set user roles using the Firebase Admin SDK (Node.js)

Alternatively, you can run this Node.js script to set roles on a Firebase
Authentication user. You can run it in your command line or as part of a Cloud
Function.

:::caution Requirements

Make sure you have your projectâ€™s service account private key JSON file from the
Firebase Console in
[Project Settings > Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk).

You should also have your Firebase Project ID handy. You can find it in the
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general).

:::

```js
import * as admin from "firebase-admin";

// ðŸ‘‰ Set your project ID. Find it in:
// https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general
const projectId = "YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE";
console.log(`Running on ${projectId}`);

// ðŸ‘‰ Import your service account key file.
// Make sure to change this path if necessary.
const serviceAccount = require(`./firebase-service-account.json`);

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: `https://${projectId}.firebaseio.com`,
});
export const auth = admin.auth();

const setClaims = async (email, claims) => {
  const user = await auth.getUserByEmail(email);
  auth.setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, claims);
};

// ðŸ‘‰ Call the setClaims function. Set the email and roles here.
setClaims("EMAIL", {
  roles: ["ADMIN"],
});
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Write Firestore Security Rules with user roles

You can set Firestore Security Rules in the
[Firebase Console&nbsp;&UpperRightArrow;](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/firestore/rules)

If youâ€™re not familiar with writing Firestore Security Rules, read the
[Firebase guide&nbsp;&UpperRightArrow;](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-structure)

### Required rules

:::caution Required

Rowy configuration is stored in the `_rowy_` collection on Firestore. Your users
will need read access to this collection and admins will need write access. The
following rules add those permissions.

:::

```js
rules_version = '2'
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Allow admins to read and write all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if hasAnyRole(["ADMIN", "OWNER"]);
    }

    // Rowy: Allow signed in users to read Rowy configuration and admins to write
    match /_rowy_/{docId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if hasAnyRole(["ADMIN", "OWNER"]);
    	match /{document=**} {
        allow read: if request.auth != null;
        allow write: if hasAnyRole(["ADMIN", "OWNER"]);
      }
    }
    // Rowy: Allow users to edit their settings
    match /_rowy_/userManagement/users/{userId} {
      allow get, update, delete: if isDocOwner(userId);
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
    // Rowy: Allow public to read public Rowy configuration
    match /_rowy_/publicSettings {
    	allow get: if true;
    }

    // Rowy: Utility functions
    function isDocOwner(docId) {
      return request.auth != null && (request.auth.uid == resource.id || request.auth.uid == docId);
    }
    function hasAnyRole(roles) {
      return request.auth != null && request.auth.token.roles.hasAny(roles);
    }

  }
}
```

### Table rules

Write table rules that match the roles you set in Table Settings. The following
are examples of different table rules, using the helper functions in the
required rules above.  
[Read more about how to write rules&nbsp;&UpperRightArrow;](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/rules-structure)

#### Example: Collection open to public

```js
match /openToPublic/{docId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if hasAnyRole(["ADMIN", "EDITOR"]);
}
```

#### Example: Collection and subcollections open to public

```js
match /openToPublicWithSubcollections/{document=**} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if hasAnyRole(["ADMIN", "EDITOR"]);
}
```

#### Example: User data

```js
match /users/{docId} {
  allow create: if request.auth != null;
  allow get, update, delete: if isDocOwner(userId);
}
```

#### Example: Admin-only

```js
match /adminOnly/{docId} {
  allow read, write: if hasAnyRole(["ADMIN", "EDITOR"]);
}
```
