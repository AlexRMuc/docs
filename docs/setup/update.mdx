If you deployed Rowy on [rowy.app](https://rowy.app/deploy), you’ll receive the
latest updates to Rowy as we release them.
[View releases&nbsp;↗️](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/releases)

Otherwise, if you’re self-hosting Rowy, you can get release updates through the
`main` branch on GitHub.

The update procedure depends on whether you cloned the Rowy repo directly or
forked it on GitHub first.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="clone" label="Cloned directly" default>

## You cloned the repo directly

If you cloned the repo and did not change the Git remotes, you can pull directly
from `origin`.

1. Get the latest commits:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Update frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Run the app locally to test:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

### You committed changes

If you committed any changes to the code, excluding adding config files, you can
follow the same procedure above.

However, you may see the following in your terminal:

```bash
Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/rowyio/rowy
# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
```

If the terminal says `nano` above that, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>X</kbd> to
merge the changes.  
If it does not, you may be using vim. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd>, then type `:wq`,
then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> to merge the changes.

If a merge conflict, you must resolve them before continuing.

<TabItem value="fork" label="Forked on GitHub">

## You forked Rowy on Github

If you forked Rowy using GitHub and cloned your fork repository, your `origin`
remote will be set to your fork.

1. Set the Rowy repo as the `upstream` repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rowyio/rowy.git
   ```

2. Fetch the latest commits from `upstream`:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. Check out your fork’s local `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

4. Merge the changes from `upstream/main` into your local `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

   If you have made any changes to the code, excluding adding config files, you
   will likely face a merge conflict. You must resolve them before continuing.

5. Update frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

6. Run the app locally to test:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

7. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

## Rebuild and redeploy Rowy

Once you have received the latest updates to Rowy on your local repository, you
should rebuild and redeploy Rowy to your hosting service.

1. Build the app:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

2. If you’re using Firebase Hosting, you can run:

   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

   This will deploy Rowy to Firebase Hosting with the target set to `rowy`.
