Logging is an essential part of debugging and monitoring code. Rowy provides accessible build, runtime, and audit logs for the cloud functions.

Cloud Logging is a fully managed service that allows the user to analyze, monitor, and alert on logging data and events from Firebase projects.

The Cloud Functions logger provides a standard interface that has a similar api to `console.log` statements and supports other log levels.

While creating a Rowy project, cloud logs can come really handy to thoroughly examine changes during deployment. 

To access the Rowy Cloud Logs, navigate to the menu on the top right corner of your project table. Locate and click the **Cloud Logs** button.
