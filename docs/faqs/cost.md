## What would using Rowy cost me?

You can use Rowy in two modes. Rowy Base and Rowy Pro.

## Rowy Base

- A fully free and open-source hosted version of the Rowy App
- Get access to the core features: CMS for one Firestore project. Ability to import and export data in bulk - csv, tsv, json formats Automate tasks and workflows with cloud functions (unlocked by deploying of Rowy Run).

    
   ### **Rowy Cost**
    
    Under Rowy Base, you will not incur any charge from Rowy

    
   ### **GCP Cost**
    
    - Rowy is 100% serverless, which means theres no ongoing server cost. You only pay for what you use on GCP. With Rowy, you are mainly using Firestore, cloud functions and cloud run. GCP‚Äôs free tier is quite generous with $300 in credits for all Firebase projects and if you are a startup you get up-to [$100K in credits](https://cloud.google.com/startup).
    - Table below details the cost breakdown by main usecases of Rowy. You can also use Google Cloud [price calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator) to further analysis your long term costs depending on how heavy your usage will be.
