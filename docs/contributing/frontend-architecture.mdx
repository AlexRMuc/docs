Rowy’s frontend architecture is built on the global state manager,
[Jotai](https://jotai.org/).

## How do atoms work?

Atoms represent a single piece of state.

The code in `src/atoms` contain atom **config**. They define _how_ data is
retrieved and _what_ data is stored in each atom. They do **not** store data.

Creating an atom config here does **not** immediately cause the atom to be
loaded in the app—they need to be called by `useAtom` (or similar Hook) first.

This then calls the atom’s read function (the first argument in the atom
config), which then stores data against the atom config in the nearest matching
**Provider**.

See [the Jotai docs](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/primitives) for a more
comprehensive explanation.

When an atom is called in a component, it’s effectively the same as `useState`.
So when the atom’s value updates, that component re-renders. Be careful of this
and be deliberate when using atoms. For example, memoized Table sub-components
intentionally do not call atoms in `projectScope` to reduce the number of
re-renders.

may help explain this concept.

## Atoms reference

Atom configs are organized by scope and function. Comments are provided above
the atom config, including examples of how to use them. These are important
because of the different [types of atoms](#types-of-atoms) we have (see below).

For an index of available atoms, see
**[rowy-typedoc.vercel.app](https://rowy-typedoc.vercel.app/)**

## Providers and scopes

We use Jotai [Providers](https://jotai.org/docs/basics/primitives#provider) with
different scopes to separate different parts of state throughout the app.

| Scope          | Purpose                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `projectScope` | Stores atoms for project config, current user information, Rowy Run, and project-level UI state. |
| `tableScope`   | Stores atoms for a table’s config, rows, functions to update a table, and table-level UI state.  |

By using scoped Providers, we can provide different states for different
component sub-trees.

<details>

<summary>Example: Sub-Tables are children of Tables</summary>

For example, we render a Sub-Table page as a **child** of the Table page, each
with their own Provider. They then render the same Table component, which gets
the data from the nearest Provider with `tableScope`. A simplified version looks
like:

```tsx
<Provider scope={tableScope}>
  <Table /> {/* Root table */}
  <Provider scope={tableScope}>
    <Table /> {/* Sub-table */}
  </Provider>
</Provider>
```

![Diagram explaining the concept](./assets/nested-providers.png)

The two Table components rendered have independent states\* because they
interact with different Providers, despite using the same `tableScope`.

<details>

<summary>*Except atoms that store their value in the URL hash</summary>

These atoms (e.g. modal open states) cannot be independent, so in this case,
when the sub-table is open, we disable modals in the root table.

In the future, we could make a modification to `atomWithHash` that prepends the
scope or an ID to the name in the URL, so we can have `#rootTable-modal=` and
`#subTable-modal=` in the same URL. But currently, only one modal appears at a
time, so this isn’t necessary.

## Sources

The standard Jotai pattern is to define _how_ to get data in the atom config
itself. We don’t do this to allow for **multiple sources of data**, so we can
expand from Firestore and Firebase in the future. Many atoms in `projectScope`
and `tableScope` only define _what_ data they store.

Data is retrieved and stored in atoms using **Source** components, which have
effects that run when they’re mounted. These Source components must be rendered
inside a Provider.

![Diagram explaining the concept](./assets/sources.png)

- `App` renders `ProjectSourceFirebase` to populate the `projectScope` atoms.
- `ProvidedTablePage` and `ProvidedSubTablePage` render `TableSourceFirestore`
  to populate the `tableScope` atoms. This allows us to have a `TablePage`
  component that displays the Table UI, and can expect to have all atoms in
  `tableScope` available, regardless of the source of data.

## Types of atoms

To implement multiple sources, we have different “types” of atoms, which are
consumed in different ways. It’s best to check the atom config’s comment to find
out which type it is. As such, **it’s important to keep these comments up to
date.**

### Read-only atoms

Store a value in the atom from a Source. You cannot modify the value of these
atoms directly.

```tsx
const [currentUser] = useAtom(currentUserAtom, projectScope);
```

### Read-write atoms

Store a value in the atom, and provide a way to update that value. These are
typically used for UI state, including `atomWithHash`, which stores the value in
the URL.

**Component that uses the value:**

```tsx
const [state, setState] = useAtom(confirmDialogAtom, projectScope);
```

**Component that can set the value, but is not dependent on the value:**

```tsx
const confirm = useSetAtom(confirmDialogAtom, projectScope);
confirm({ handleConfirm: () => ... });
```

### Function atoms

**Store a function** that can be called in the **atom’s value**. Calling this
function will run code that will update another atom’s value.

These atoms are necessary to provide a way to update data that come from
Sources. For example, `updateProjectSettingsAtom` could contain a function to
update the project settings for a non-Firebase project in the future.

```tsx
const [updateProjectSettings] = useAtom(updateProjectSettingsAtom, projectScope);
if (updateProjectSettings) {
	updateProjectSettings({ ... });
}
```

### Write-only atoms

Do not store a value. Calling the write function will run code that will update
another atom’s value.

These atoms are like simpler versions of function atoms, and can have automated
testing, since they are independent of Sources.

These are dependent on a more generic function atom to update the value in the
Source, but can call the same code regardless of the Source.

For example, `addRowAtom` does the same tasks (e.g. check for missing values),
then calls `_updateRowDbAtom` to write the new row to the database.
`TableSourceFirestore` provides the function stored in `_updateRowDbAtom`.

```tsx
const addRow = useSetAtom(addRowAtom, tableScope);
addRow({ row: [ {...}, ... ] });
```

## Suspense

Jotai has built-in support for
[React Suspense](https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/Suspense). This means we
don’t need to check if an atom’s value is still loading in many places.

### Built-in Suspense support

If an atom config’s read function has an `async` request or call, the nearest
component will suspend while that Promise is not resolved.

Any component that uses that atom (`useAtom`) can expect the atom’s value to
**always** be there, instead of an `undefined` state to denote loading.

### Simulated Suspense behavior

But to support multiple sources for `projectScope` and `tableScope` atoms, we
cannot rely on Jotai’s Suspense support, since we don’t specify how to get data
in the atom config’s read function.

So we simulate this behavior by initially setting the atom’s value to be a
Promise that never resolves, then set the value correctly when the data has been
loaded in.

<details>
  
<summary>Example: <code>currentUserAtom</code></summary>

For example, we set the value of `currentUserAtom` as a Promise while we wait
for Firebase to authenticate.

```tsx
(setCurrentUser as any)(new Promise(() => {}));

firebaseAuth.onAuthStateChanged(async (user) => {
	setCurrentUser(user);
	...
}
```

However, this means the very first render of the component will have
`currentUserAtom`’s value be `undefined` (loading) instead of `null` (signed
out), so we still need to check the value in `App`.

```tsx
{
  currentUser === undefined ? (
    <Loading fullScreen message="Authenticating" />
  ) : (
    <Routes>...</Routes>
  );
}
```

| `atoms`             | Atom configs.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `components`        | Components used inside pages and general components used throughout the app.                                                                                                  |
| `components/fields` | All code used to implement field types, including Table cell and Side Drawer field code.                                                                                      |
| `config`            | Constants that can be used to meaningfully configure the app, especially for open source users.                                                                               |
| `constants`         | Constants used throughout the app that shouldn’t be configurable.                                                                                                             |
| `contexts`          | Any React Contexts used in the app. Avoid adding to this and use Jotai atoms instead, unless if a feature or 3rd-party package needs it, like snackbars.                      |
| `hooks`             | General-purposes Hooks that can be used throughout the app. For example, Firestore collection and document listeners are Hooks stored here.                                   |
| `layouts`           | Implements layouts used in pages. For example, the side navigation drawer and auth layout.                                                                                    |
| `pages`             | Page components rendered by React Router routes. Generally, these use Jotai atoms and pass data into components. These also render Sources.                                   |
| `sources`           | Components that run effects and other code, which inject data into Jotai atoms. For example, ProjectSourceFirebase injects data into projectScope using Firebase as a source. |
| `test`              | General test scripts, such as rendering the whole app. Test scripts can also live alongside the code they’re testing, like `src/atoms/tableScope/columnActions.test.ts`       |
| `theme`             | Code to implement Rowy’s MUI theme. Modify these files to apply global style changes.                                                                                         |
| `types`             | Types used throughout the app, such as ColumnConfig.                                                                                                                          |
| `utils`             | Small utility functions used to standardize behavior across the app. For example, rowyUser creates the same object to store the current user’s data in a table.               |
