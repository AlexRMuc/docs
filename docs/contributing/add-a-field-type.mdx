If one of the [30+ field types](../field-types/supported-fields.mdx) don’t
support your data type or you want to provide an alternate UI to edit your data,
you can add a field type by writing your own code.

## Step 1: Declare your new field type and set up the config

1. Add a new entry to the `FieldType` enum in
   [`src/constants/fields.ts`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/constants/fields.ts).
   The all-caps SNAKE_CASE name will be the internal name used in the table
   schema to identify this field type.
2. Set up the code for the new field type in
   [`src/components/fields`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/tree/main/src/components/fields).
   Either:
   1. Clone one of the existing field directories. Make sure to update
      `config.type` and `config.name` in the `index.ts` file.
   2. Create an empty directory. In that directory, create an `index.ts` file
      that default exports the constant `config` and implements the interface
      [`IFieldConfig`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/components/fields/types.ts#L15).
3. Use the
   [`withRenderTableCell()`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/components/Table/TableCell/withRenderTableCell.tsx)
   higher-order component to render your table cells. It takes a Display Cell to
   display values and an Editor Cell to edit values.

## Step 2: Build your Display Cell

Display Cells strictly only display the cell’s value. These are also displayed
when the column is disabled/read-only.

1.  Create a component that takes
    [`IDisplayCellProps`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/components/fields/types.ts#L46).

    - Keep this component lightweight, i.e. use base HTML or simple MUI
      components. Avoid `Tooltip`, which is heavy.
    - Avoid displaying disabled states (e.g. do not reduce opacity/grey out
      toggles). This improves the experience of read-only tables for non-admins.
    - If you use row data (excluding the current field), make sure to pass the
      `usesRowData` option to `withRenderTableCell()`

      :::caution Warning

      Make sure the disabled state does not render the buttons to open a popover
      `EditorCell` (like Single/Multi Select).

      :::

      :::caution Warning

      Make sure to use the `tabIndex` prop for buttons and other interactive
      elements.

      :::

## Step 3: Build your Editor Cell

Editor Cells are used to take user input and update the cell’s value. They are
displayed when:

1. **focus** (default): the user has focused on the cell by pressing Enter or
   double-clicking,
2. **inline**: always displayed if the cell is editable, or
3. **popover**: inside a popover when a user has focused on the cell (as above)
   or clicked a button rendered by Display Cell

You can set when they are displayed for your field type using the `editorMode`
parameter in `withRenderTableCell()`.

1.  Create a component that takes
    [`IEditorCellProps`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/components/fields/types.ts#L65).
2.  Use the `value` and `onChange` props for your input component. The Table
    will store the user input locally. Avoid creating another local state in
    your cell component.

    - By default, the value is saved when the component unmounts (user removes
      focus from cell) and the user has changed the value.

      :::caution Warning

      If the Editor Cell is displayed inline, you must call `onSubmit` to save
      the value to the database, because it never unmounts.

      :::

    Alternatively, you can pass `null` to `withRenderTableCell()` to always
    display the Display Cell.

:::caution Warning

Make sure to use the `tabIndex` prop for buttons and other interactive elements.

:::info Note

You can reuse your Side Drawer field (next step) as they take the same props. It
should probably be displayed in a popover.

:::

## Step 4: Build your Side Drawer field

This component is displayed in the Side Drawer for this field type. Visually, it
looks a form field.

1. Create a component that takes
   [`ISideDrawerFieldProps`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/components/fields/types.ts#L60).
2. Use the `value` and `onChange` props for your input component. The Side
   Drawer will store the user input locally. Avoid creating another local state
   in your cell component.
3. Call the `onSubmit` prop when you’re ready to save the value to the database.
   Typically, this is called `onBlur`.
   - You can call it even if the user hasn’t changed the value. The Side Drawer
     tracks if the user has interacted with your input.

:::info Use standard field styles

You can use `fieldSx` to get the standard field styles, if you’re not using an
MUI `TextField`:

```tsx
import { fieldSx } from "@src/components/SideDrawer/utils";
import { spreadSx } from "@src/utils/ui";

...

sx={[
  { ...your styles here },
  ...spreadSx(props.sx),
]}
```

:::

## Step 5: Export the field config

When you’re ready to test your new field type, export the code and field config.

1. Import the field code directory in
   [`src/components/fields/index.tsx`](https://github.com/rowyio/rowy/blob/develop/src/components/fields/index.tsx).
2. Export the config as part of the `FIELDS` constant.
3. Create a new column in a table with your new field type.
