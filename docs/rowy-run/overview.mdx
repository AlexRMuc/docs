Rowy Run is a Cloud Run instance that provides backend functionality, such as
table action scripts, user management, and easy Cloud Function deployment.

It operates exclusively on your GCP project, so we never have access to any of
your data. Like Rowy, it’s completely open source and free to use.

## Install Rowy Run

:::warning Required

Before starting, make sure you have a Google Cloud or Firebase project with
**Firestore** and **Firebase Authentication** enabled, and upgraded to the
**Blaze Plan**.

Don’t have a project?
[Learn how to create one&nbsp;→](../setup/firebase-project.md)

:::

If you installed Rowy using the [quick deploy method](../setup/install.md), Rowy
Run is already set up on your project.

Otherwise, you can install Rowy Run manually.

:::note Required software

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 14 (it’s easiest to install using
  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro))
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) 1
- [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) 363+

:::

1. Enable the Cloud Run Admin API in the
   [Google Cloud console &UpperRightArrow;](http://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/run.googleapis.com)  
   Make sure you have
   [billing enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project)
   first.

2. Make sure you’ve initialized the gcloud CLI and signed in to the correct
   account.

   ```bash
   gcloud init
   ```

3. Clone the Rowy Run repo and open the created directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rowyio/rowyRun.git
   cd rowyRun
   ```

4. Install dependencies using Yarn.

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

5. Run the deploy script with the correct project ID.

   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh --project [ID]
   ```

6. Set up a service account for your Rowy Run instance with the **Service
   Account User** and **Firebase Admin** roles in the Google Cloud console by
   following the video below:

   <Video url={videoUrl} muted playsinline controls />

   You can verify the service account has the required permissions in the Rowy
   Run setup flow, `/setup`.

## How it works

Rowy Run uses the
[Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) and
[Google Cloud SDKs](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-node) to make
changes to your project. To use these SDKs, it requires a
[service account](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/service-accounts)
with these [IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles):

- Service Account User
- Firebase Admin

You can set up the service account in the Rowy setup flow, `/setup`.
