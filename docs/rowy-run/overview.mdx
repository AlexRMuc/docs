Rowy Run is a Cloud Run instance that provides backend functionality, such as
table action scripts, user management, and easy Cloud Function deployment.

It operates exclusively on your GCP project, so we never have access to any of
your data. Like Rowy, it’s completely open source and free to use.

## How it works

Rowy Run uses the
[Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) and
[Google Cloud SDKs](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-node) to make
changes to your project. To use these SDKs, it requires a
[service account](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/service-accounts)
with these [IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles):

- Service Account User – required to deploy Cloud Functions
- Firebase Authentication Admin
- Firestore Service Agent
